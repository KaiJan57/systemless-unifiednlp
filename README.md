# systemless-unifiednlp
This magisk module aims to simplify installing UnifiedNlp ([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.google.android.gms/)) systemless-ly with correctly-set permissions to provide users without Gapps a nice way to use network-based location services without going through all the hassle of installing it manually (cf. [a good, but complicated manual](https://blog.eowyn.net/unifiednlp/)).

I thought it would be nice to share it with other magisk users, as setting up network-based-location on devices without Gapps is not trivial at all, which this module hopefully solves.
